Principles of Software Development Projects

###This repository includes programming assignment (PA) zip files submitted for USC's CSCI201 class. It also includes files from a final project completed for the class.

###PA 1 is essentially a program centered around a fast-list of station objects. The main functionality is traversing the fast-list to find and return a desirable station.
###PA 2 uses a linked list of sorted arrays to create an amortized array-based dictionary.
###PA 3 uses multithreading to simulate a delivery system from multiple restaurants to a single home location.
###PA 4 accomplishes a similar goal to PA3 using a client-server model and pulling data from Yelp's API.

###The final project, named Posty, enabled users to create accounts, grocery lists, and grocery groups. By allowing users to discover one anothers' groups, Posty essentially enables coordination of grocery lists, which is a service that current popular applications - such as Instacart - lack.
