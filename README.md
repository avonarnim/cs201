Principles of Software Development Projects

This repository includes programming assignment (PA) zip files submitted for USC's CSCI201 class.
PA 1 is essentially a program centered around a fast-list of station objects. The main functionality is traversing the fast-list to find and return a desirable station.
PA 2 uses a linked list of sorted arrays to create an amortized array-based dictionary.
PA 3 uses multithreading to simulate a delivery system from multiple restaurants to a single home location.
PA 4 accomplishes a similar goal to PA3 using a client-server model and pulling data from Yelp's API.
